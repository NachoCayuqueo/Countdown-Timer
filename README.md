## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See a live countdown timer that ticks down every second. Start the count by making a difference between the current date and January 1 of the following year.

- **Bonus**: When a number is changed, the card is flipped from the middle
